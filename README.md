# CS255-System-Analysis-and-Design

# Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?
Our client for this project is DriverPass. The system they wanted me to design is for training students for their driving tests at their local DMV. They want to use this system as a way to provide training packages to customers and help them take online tests and practice tests to train them better in driving.

# What did you do particularly well?
I feel like I did the business requirements document well, in all the areas needed to be addressed. I read the transcript thoroughly, so I considered each required section accounting to the client's needs.

# If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
The document I would revise would be the systems design document. I covered certain activity diagrams that covered some parts of the clients requests such as the process of collecting payment and logging into the website. I feel like the way to improve this document is by covering all features required like the driving instructor UI in the website or the admins steps to removing an account.

# How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
When reading the transcript, we should highlight key features that the client wants and clarify more into what they want. It is important to consider the user's needs in designing because this will prevent miscommunication and help accurately implement the design without any major setbacks. 

# How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?
My main strategy when it comes to analyzing and designing a system is strong documentation between the designing company and the client. I would need to cover all aspects and potential areas required for the system's design and clarify back and forth when designing the system's software. Then I would provide them a summarize document and check off if all requirements have been met and then move forward into development.
